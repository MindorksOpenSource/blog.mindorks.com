Normally, the UI elements are notified when there is a change in data. Also, only that observers will be notified that are in Live state. So, let's explore this.

Fingerprint Authentication is the best way for authentication because you need not worry about remembering the password and it is a very fast process also. So, let's see how we can do this in our application.

              In this blog, we will learn how to implement Paging Library in Android. Paging Library is used to get only a selected amount of data out of a heap of data i.e. at a particular instant of time only the desired amount of data will be loaded in the application. This feature is very important for applications using infinite scrolling. We have created a full tutorial for Paging.
